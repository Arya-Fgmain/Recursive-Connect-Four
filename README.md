## So... *Recursive* Connect Four?
I made this game for fun back in 2021. It's built entirely in Java, using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## How does it work?
The classes are outlined here.

**Slot**: represents the pieces in the game. Each slot has an integer value which represents its color (red/black). This is used to print the appropriate flag for each piece -- (R) for red and (B) for black.
**Player**: represents the players, each player has an ID (either 0/1) that is used to determine who's turn it is.
